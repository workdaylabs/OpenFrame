Workday Open Frame
===============

Workday Open Frame (WOF) is an open-source plug-in to Microsoft Internet Explorer that allows for modern web technologies to work within older versions of IE browsers (IE 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x). This plug-in allows for specific websites to be render using the open-source Chromium browser (http://www.chromium.org/Home) which supports modern web technologies instead of the older IE rendering engine. 

At Workday, we are committed to building cloud applications that go beyond the limits of traditional enterprise software. In order to achieve our goal of providing unparalleled levels of user experience within our applications, we make use of the new capabilities available only in modern browsers and this plug-in allow for our customers who remain on older IE browser versions to experience all of the new Workday features and functionality.
